<p>In this user guide I will show you the basic functionality of the alarm clock app</p>
<p>In the first screen of the app you can see that it has 2 buttons at the top of the screen. One called spotify and one called add. The Spotify button will allow you to log into spotify and the add button will create an alarm and prompt you for a title.</p>

	<img class = "home" src = "Webview pix/Home.PNG">

	<img class = "home" src = "Webview pix/AlarmTitle.PNG">

<p>Once the title has been inputted, you can see the alarm has been created. When you click on the alarm it will take you to the edit alarm page.</p>

	<img class = "home" src = "Webview pix/Created alarm.PNG">

	<img class = "home" src = "Webview pix/Edit Alarm.PNG">

<p>In this page you can edit your alarm title, edit the alarm time, toggle the alarm, delete the alarm or save the alarm. When you click on set time, the app will present a time picker for you to pick your alarm time</p>

	<img class = "home" src = "Webview pix/Time Picker.PNG">

<p>Once your alarm time is picked then you can save the alarm by clicking the save button. This will return you to main page.</p>

	<img class = "home" src = "Webview pix/Set alarm.PNG">

<p>When the alarm goes off it will display a notification for you</p>
